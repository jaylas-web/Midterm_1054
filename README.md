<h1>Netflix vs Going to the movies.</h1>
<p>Hello my name is John,I am pro Netflix completely. My reasons for choosing Netflix over going to the movies are , that you dont have to leave the confort of your own home, movies are very costly if you go with a partner. with the ticket cost and the snacks and the transportation if you do not live close can all add up. If you love movies and you take time to set up your home to enjoy them movies at home is a better choice.</p>

<p>Hello my name is Isaac. I love going to the movies! I dont understand why you would want to minimize the expirience of watching a really good movie at home. going to the movies and watching it on a big screen with popcorn and making it an outting for you and who ever you go with is special. Movies at home are great but it does not compair to the movie theatre.</P>
